# README for the RFC-AI Initiative Repository

## Welcome to the RFC-AI Initiative Repository\!

This repository serves as the official home for the **drafts (AI-Drafts)** and **published documents (RFC-AIs)** of the RFC-AI Standardization Initiative. Our mission is to foster a more interoperable, secure, accountable, and transparent Artificial Intelligence (AI) ecosystem. To achieve this, we develop open, consensus-driven technical standards for AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-agent systems, and related technologies.

Inspired by the successful Internet Request for Comments (RFC) model, our goal is to provide clear, implementable specifications that complement existing standardization efforts. All our documents are managed in **Markdown** and version-controlled using **GitHub**, which facilitates open collaboration and agile development.

We invite you to explore our documents, contribute your ideas, and actively participate in building a more standardized future for AI.
